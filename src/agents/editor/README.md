# Editor

An ordinary hosted Agent Framework image calls stable agent routes through the
OpenAI Responses SDK: writer first, then auditor with the draft and original
request. It returns both results as Markdown sections labelled
with each specialist's name and pinned version, visible in the chat playground.
The auditor receives the writer's text, not display labels.
Failed, incomplete or empty responses abort the sequence; no automatic retries,
fallback, discovery or runtime provisioning are performed.

Required bindings are `WRITER_NAME`, `WRITER_VERSION`, `WRITER_RESPONSES_BASE_URL`,
`AUDITOR_NAME`, `AUDITOR_VERSION` and `AUDITOR_RESPONSES_BASE_URL`.
Each base URL ends in `/agents/{name}/`; the SDK appends
`responses`. Credentials, query strings and unpinned paths are rejected.
Authentication uses direct Keycloak OAuth client credentials configured by
`KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` and `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`.
Both calls explicitly disable server-side storage.
Edge supplies identity sidecars and bindings. The Responses host SDK is retained;
no Foundry project or agent client is used. Cloud-specific routing/user delegation
and same-image Foundry hosting remain unqualified.
The image contains no Adaptive client library or Kubernetes/Radius access.

The deterministic pipeline uses Agent Framework's `AgentTelemetryLayer`, the
same native invocation layer used by framework chat agents. Each foreground
or streaming run emits `invoke_agent editor`; SDK-managed HTTPX instrumentation
propagates its trace context to both OpenAI-compatible peers. Errors are
reported on that invocation span and still abort the sequence. There are no
handwritten OpenTelemetry spans or propagation hooks, no editor LLM call,
and no artificial tool calls.

for native Radius delivery.
