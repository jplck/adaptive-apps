# Native agents with Radius

This fork adds an optional native agent capability alongside the unchanged
trading application. Radius deploys prompt/hosted agents directly; there is no
agent lifecycle operator, Kubernetes agent CRD, Foundry management emulation or
API reconciliation loop. The existing `aiModels` and `agentGuardrails` Radius
types are extended, not registered again under conflicting contracts. Their
trading recipes remain independent of the native-agent environment.

## Ownership and boundaries

| Declaration | Native implementation | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents` | Logical ConfigMap plus one mutable singleton StatefulSet, Service, HTTPRoute, AgentgatewayPolicy and NetworkPolicy | Logical metadata and state PVC retained; current runtime updated in place |
| `agentIdentities` | Keycloak client, optional Entra blueprint/principal/Agent ID, Secret, binding ConfigMap and ServiceAccount | Independent protected Terraform state |
| `aiModels` | Gateway configuration; KAITO/vLLM inference, existing inference Service, remote Foundry binding or virtual priority group | Weights/cache retained |
| `agentGuardrails` | Native policy ConfigMap | Retained; the current agent records exact attached content |
| `keycloakLogins` | Existing-realm PKCE client and optional reviewed Entra federation | Separate administrator environment |

The portfolio Helm release owns the additive native capability, shared
PostgreSQL-backed Keycloak and one OTel Collector. Stock Helm releases own
upstream Envoy for UI/model ingress and upstream agentgateway for agent
ingress. Radius owns application models, login clients, logical agents and
retained identities, not either gateway release. Superseded native
H2/Keycloak, collector and platform Terraform
implementations have been removed.

Invocation uses two independent gateway boundaries:

```text
application -> Agent Gateway -> agent -> Model Gateway -> model
```

Upstream agentgateway authenticates callers, authorizes exact stable agent
routes, strips caller credentials, routes requests, and emits gateway
telemetry. Strict body-aware Responses admission is optional and disabled by
default; set `strictResponses` in `agents.json` to reject stored, referenced,
or background operations at the gateway. Agents use their paired Keycloak
OAuth clients directly for in-cluster Model Gateway and peer-agent calls.
LiteLLM owns model routing and provider identity. Connected Graph delegation
remains an explicit colocated broker backed by the official Entra sidecar; it
is not part of model invocation.

Native ValidatingAdmissionPolicies keep logical kind/ownership,
prevent a second runtime replica (including the scale subresource), reject
cross-agent identity bindings and protect platform-injected runtime fields.
Native names derive from the retained identity's stable logical UID. Updating
the same Radius agent rolls the current workload and cannot create a second
state writer.
Do not force-delete a writer or bypass admission. Singleton scheduling is not
distributed fencing or crash recovery.

The agent environment explicitly binds one shared native namespace to logical,
identity, runtime and model recipes. Radius's application-specific
`context.runtime.kubernetes.namespace` is not this shared namespace. This keeps
independently owned identities, identity federation subjects and diagnostics
on the same contract; application deletion does not own the shared namespace.
Guardrail policy declarations retain their separate application/platform scopes.

Agents retain their existing native Responses-host implementations and OCI
build inputs in `src/agents/{prompt-agent,editor}`. Build these Dockerfiles with
`src` as context. They use standard Keycloak client credentials for in-cluster
gateway calls. The environment supplies model, telemetry, optional governance
and connected Graph delegation bindings. Prompt MCP/skills,
stored/child/background Responses, hosted delegation, evaluation Jobs and
same-image cloud hosting are not qualified by this capability.

Ordinary calls go directly through authorized agentgateway ingress to
`POST /agents/{agent}/responses`. Agentgateway removes browser credentials and
delegation inputs before SDK handling. When strict Responses admission is
enabled, the separate policy service admits only foreground plain-text
requests with explicit `store=false`; native child, reference, and background
operations are denied. All edge model calls and
`GET /v1/models` use authenticated `model-ingress`/LiteLLM, never the diagnostics
API or an inference Pod directly.

The diagnostic API reads retained metadata and current native StatefulSet,
PVC, Gateway, HTTPRoute and authorization-policy conditions. It writes no
agent resource, workload or identity. An effective endpoint
requires one ready, current-revision replica, Bound state, current-generation
accepted/programmed ingress and exact Radius ownership. An unready update does
not produce a success-shaped endpoint and there is no release fallback.
Monitor reads bounded native Jaeger/Loki records, not manufactured events.

Native Responses host traces use the SDK's signal-specific
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`: localhost `a365-collector` forwards them
to the central collector and Jaeger. The stock per-agent collector supplies
declared agent identity and, when connected, tenant/blueprint attributes without
changing span names, operation names or parent relationships. Logs and metrics
retain their central SDK endpoint. The sidecar has bounded in-memory retry,
not durable replay.

This local Monitor path does not establish Microsoft 365 cloud ingestion:
the old operator's separate authenticated A365 export branch is not implemented
in this capability. Cloud registration, permissions, licensing and delivery
remain separate gates; disabling the SDK's direct cloud exporter prevents
accidental duplicate or unqualified exports.

## Delivery

Use an isolated cluster for first qualification. Kubernetes 1.33+ with
ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, a NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI, Radius, a default
persistent StorageClass and registry/archive access are prerequisites.
The KAITO model variant additionally needs the fork's AI portfolio and suitable
GPU nodes. Installation/downloads are not disconnected operation.

This follows Adaptive Apps' existing split between
[cluster/platform preparation](../../tutorials/getting-started/README.md#2-bring-up-the-platform)
and application-owned Radius declarations. Connected clusters first complete
the existing [Arc preparation guide](../../tutorials/common/prepare-arc.md),
including the actual Kubernetes signer configuration. Do not install two
Keycloak or gateway owners over the same resources. The native capability is
`min-ai` plus an additive application feature, not a seventh portfolio or a
claim to qualify every `core`/`ent` gate.

### Local artifact and executor preparation

Install stock Envoy and agentgateway **before Radius** on a fresh cluster.
Envoy v1.9.2 ships
Gateway API v1.6.1; Radius 0.61 otherwise installs v1.4.0 CRDs first.
Do not force conflicting CRD ownership or run another CRD installation over
provider-managed incompatible resources. The CLI fails that preflight.
For a provider-managed compatible Gateway API installation, follow the
[upstream separate-CRD installation](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/install/install-helm/)
and [compatibility matrix](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/news/releases/matrix/).

```bash
helm upgrade --install adaptive-envoy oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm \
  --version v1.9.2 -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace \
  --wait --timeout 10m
helm upgrade --install agentgateway-crds \
  oci://cr.agentgateway.dev/charts/agentgateway-crds \
  --version v1.6.0 -n agentgateway-system --create-namespace --wait
kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
helm upgrade --install agentgateway \
  oci://cr.agentgateway.dev/charts/agentgateway \
  --version v1.6.0 -n agentgateway-system --create-namespace \
  --set 'rbac.gatewayNamespaces[0]=YOUR_NAMESPACE' --wait --timeout 10m
```

Then install stock Radius using the existing manual bootstrap pattern, without
a second Contour installation:

```bash
rad install kubernetes --skip-contour-install
rad version
kubectl get deployments -n radius-system
```

Use the existing Radius workspace/group procedure. A private kubeconfig and
Radius config under ignored `.adaptive/access/` avoid changing another
workspace's context. `radius/prerequisites.yaml` provides stock PVC-backed
artifact/OCI servers and the native executor installer role:

When isolating Radius with a custom `HOME`, its workspace command also needs
the selected kubeconfig at `$HOME/.kube/config` and Bicep in `$HOME/.rad/bin`;
`KUBECONFIG` alone is insufficient for that stock command. Copy the selected
existing kubeconfig, never regenerate credentials.

```bash
kubectl apply -f radius/prerequisites.yaml
kubectl -n radius-system rollout status deployment/agent-artifacts --timeout=180s
kubectl -n radius-system rollout status deployment/agent-recipe-registry --timeout=180s
```

The installer role deliberately permits native infrastructure installation in
the development cluster; it is not the diagnostic API's restricted role or a
production least-privilege claim. Its artifact ingress permits only Radius
namespace peers and carries public deployment artifacts, never credentials.
External production registries/archive servers use HTTPS.

Build images through `just --justfile src/Justfile image <component>` with an
explicit `REGISTRY`/`TAG`. A single-node K3s development cluster can import the
selected image using `docker save <image> | sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io images import -`.
Capture the imported manifest digest for the authored release; do not pass a
mutable image tag. No `agent-operator` image is built or imported.

For the optional private artifact servers, copy only public Terraform archives
into the artifact PVC through its nginx Pod. Preserve the shared Terraform
module's relative path:

```bash
mkdir -p build/bootstrap
tar --exclude=.terraform --exclude='*.tfstate*' --exclude=.test-artifacts \
  -czf build/bootstrap/recipes.tgz -C radius/recipes \
  identity identity-local identity-connected keycloak-login
sha256sum build/bootstrap/recipes.tgz
```

Use that hash as the immutable artifact-server directory; verify the downloaded
archive against it. Publish Bicep recipes
with native `rad bicep publish --plain-http` through a loopback registry
port-forward; enable the environment's explicit `plainHttp=true` only for that
private registry. Build the portfolio dependency with
`helm dependency build charts/adaptive-apps --skip-refresh`; install/package
only that parent chart. There is no native platform Helm recipe.

`radius/credentials.bicep` creates the native Radius secret store through
secure parameters. Deliver its inputs from an ignored mode-0600 private
parameter file, never command-line secret literals. Reference its returned ID
from `recipeConfig.envSecrets`.

Local setup writes only the two Keycloak keys. Graph certificate/password
parameters are optional and omitted from the store unless a reviewed
certificate is supplied. Connected setup requires both nonempty credential
files; no placeholder cloud credentials are generated.

| Executor | Environment / secret-store bindings |
| --- | --- |
| Agent identity | `KEYCLOAK_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_REALM=master`, `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=admin-cli`, `KEYCLOAK_USER=admin`; `KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD` from `keycloak-admin-password` |
| Connected identity | Exact `ARM_TENANT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_USE_CLI=false`; certificate/password from `graph-client-certificate` / `graph-client-certificate-password` |
| Login administration | `KEYCLOAK_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_REALM=adaptive`, `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=adaptive-login-config`; `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` from `keycloak-config-client-secret` |

The login executor has a separate environment and credential. Optional Entra
human federation additionally needs its reviewed login-application secret;
that is distinct from agent blueprint federation and the Graph provisioner.

### Authored delivery order

Delivery declarations and recipe implementations have different boundaries:
the former declare Radius resources; the latter are published implementations
selected by an environment. The following is the deployment map, not a second
orchestration layer.

| Authored file | Ownership / published implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `agents-env.bicep` | Environment and recipe bindings |
| `credentials.bicep` | Shared provisioning secret store |
| `agent-services.bicep` | Explicit models, their AI gateways and separately owned browser login |
| `app.bicep` | Integrated trading application, retained native identities and mutable agents |
| `agents.bicep` | Standalone reusable declaration for one retained identity and mutable agent |
| `agent-identity.bicep` | Advanced standalone declaration for independently managing the retained identity |
| `agent-policy.bicep` | Immutable policy; `recipes/agent-guardrails/native-policy.bicep` |

Bicep composes separately owned identity and agent resources in one
customer-facing application deployment. The identity recipe derives the
same-name agent resource ID and stable logical UID, then its binding is passed
into the runtime. `agents.bicep` exposes the same composition for applications
that do not use the trading sample. Do not make shared identity, credentials
or platform resources owned by the mutable workload.

1. Register `radius/resource-types/types.yaml` using
   `rad resource-type create --from-file radius/resource-types/types.yaml`.
   Generate its existing extension:
   `rad bicep publish-extension --from-file radius/resource-types/types.yaml --target radius/types.tgz`.
2. Publish `agents` at `0.6.1`, `agent-guardrails` at `0.3.0`,
   `ai-models` at `0.5.2` and `ai-gateways` at `0.2.0`, using
   `rad bicep publish`.
   Their files are `recipes/agents/logical.bicep` (which includes the internal
   `runtime.bicep` module),
   `recipes/ai-agent/native-model.bicep`,
   `recipes/ai-agent/native-gateway.bicep` and
   `recipes/agent-guardrails/native-policy.bicep`. Use the loopback registry
   address for publication, but the cluster-local address in environment
   bindings. These are local commands; CI is optional.
3. Publish an immutable Terraform source archive (HTTPS externally) containing `identity`,
   `identity-local`, `identity-connected` and `keycloak-login`
   at their existing relative paths, including lockfiles. Keep private provider
   state, `.terraform`, credentials and test artifacts out of that archive.
4. Run `ada agents-config --output agents.json --import-images` to create a
   public reviewed configuration from the origin GitHub repository and newest
   published immutable recipe release, then pull its seven selected images into
   local K3s. The import uses
   immutable `images` references when configured, otherwise
   `imageRegistry`/`imageTag`, and writes the resolved immutable digest map back
   to the public config so later initialization does not depend on retained
   containerd tags. Use
   `--repository OWNER/REPOSITORY`, `--commit FULL_SHA` or `--template PATH`
   when those defaults do not apply. An explicit commit must already have a
   `recipes-<commit>` release containing `recipes.tgz`; otherwise the command
   fails before writing configuration. Re-running the command updates only the
   archive and registry locations and preserves reviewed inputs. Then run
   `ada init --agents-config agents.json --namespace <namespace> --release <release>`.
   This creates missing durable private inputs without AI: administrator,
   database and service credentials, validated localhost TLS, secure Radius
   parameters, portfolio values and native Secret declarations. Existing
   credentials are reused; mismatching generated inputs fail for explicit review.
   After reviewing an intentional change, add `--refresh-derived-state` to replace
   only derived JSON while retaining credentials and the TLS key pair.
   Secrets are `adaptive-keycloak-admin` (`username`, `password`), `adaptive-keycloak-login-config`
   (`client-secret`, `adaptive-trading-client-secret`), `model-gateway-auth` (`master-key` and matching Envoy
   `credential`) and the UI TLS Secret. Do not regenerate existing credentials.
   Give the Radius executor native workload permissions and narrowly scoped
   access to these provisioning secrets. Connected Graph provisioning uses
   dedicated application credentials, not Azure CLI tokens.
5. Deploy `radius/agents-env.bicep` with the OCI recipe registry, archive URL,
   platform bindings, agent executor `recipeConfig` and separate
   `loginRecipeConfig`. Credentials use Radius secret-store references, never
   application parameters. The login environment has a distinct namespace and
   credentials. Local identity is the default; connected provisioning supplies
   `connected=true` plus exact tenant, sponsor, owner and OIDC issuer parameters.
   On a fresh workspace, create this environment before deploying
   `radius/credentials.bicep`; pass its exact resource ID with
   `rad deploy --environment <environment-id> --group <group>`.
   The environment may reference the store before its creation, but create
   the store before any identity/login recipe executes. Native `rad env switch`
   has no `--group` flag; explicit deployment IDs avoid workspace-default ambiguity.
   Create the namespace/Secrets before the portfolio install.
6. Use the [Getting Started native path](../../tutorials/getting-started/README.md#1-choose-your-sample-and-portfolio).
   It installs stock Envoy v1.9.2 with Lua enabled before the parent portfolio
   chart, waits for the shared Keycloak realm, then deploys
   `radius/agent-services.bicep`. The initial Helm install does not wait for
   model configuration that the subsequent Radius application creates;
   final rollout validation happens after that declaration. The chart is
   `adaptive-apps` 0.2.0 with the `agent-platform` 0.3.0 dependency.
   `ada oidc demo-users` optionally creates `alice`/`bob` with only the API
   client invocation role. Native UI clients remain Terraform-owned; `ada`
   creates or verifies the confidential `adaptive-trading` BFF client with its
   retained secret before Terraform adds its role and audience mappings, while
   the existing public `adaptive-ui` PKCE client remains unchanged.
7. Deploy `radius/app.bicep` using the exported native settings from Getting
   Started. Writer, auditor and editor are ordinary Radius components in that
   application. Each agent directly references its separately retained
   identity, so Radius resolves the binding before deploying the mutable
   runtime. Use `radius/agents.bicep` only for a standalone non-trading
   application.
8. Wait for native readiness and verify direct authenticated invocation at the
   stable endpoint. Subsequent deployments update the same current runtime.
   Publish a new immutable chart/recipe archive for recipe implementation
   changes rather than replacing an already published archive.

Platform recipe bindings are `policyServiceImage`, `strictResponses`,
`sidecarImage`, `governanceImage`, `keycloakUrl`, `keycloakService`, `issuer`,
`ingressUrl`, `otelEndpoint` and optional explicit
`peers` (`keycloakClientId`, `agentId`, `targets`). Sidecar images must be pinned
digests. Local peer identities may use `{namespace}` in `keycloakClientId` and
`agentId`; `ada init` resolves it to the selected namespace. `ingressUrl` is the
public client origin, not an internal DNS name.
The runtime NetworkPolicy uses the shared portfolio's
`app.kubernetes.io/component=keycloak` selector by default. For an existing
Keycloak deployment with different labels, supply its exact
`keycloakPodSelector` once in the environment; a Service URL alone cannot
identify the NetworkPolicy's target Pods.
Model-gateway chart values require an exact issuer/JWKS URL and explicit
per-agent Keycloak client allowlist. Connected Azure models use the gateway's
own federated workload identity; no Azure API key is introduced. Public OpenAI
enables explicit outbound TCP/443 while excluding private, loopback and
link-local ranges.

UI values include immutable `runtime.uiImage`/`apiImage`, the exact realm issuer,
TLS Secret and `environmentJson` (`name`, optional `description`,
`cloud.enabled`). Build the UI with `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=true`,
`VITE_KEYCLOAK_AUTHORITY=<exact HTTPS issuer>` and
`VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=adaptive-ui`. Nginx receives the Pod namespace at runtime;
API, Responses and model traffic retain their separate native ingress boundaries.
Grant approved human users the `adaptive-platform-api` client role `agent.invoke`.
Audience claims alone do not grant invocation.

The optional trading integration deploys the retained identities, mutable
agents and the same UI build in one Radius application deployment. The UI is
an independent `Applications.Core/containers` service. Vite uses base
`/agents/`; the trading BFF serves it under the trading origin, performs the
single confidential OIDC flow, keeps tokens server-side, refreshes them once
under concurrency, and attaches the bearer only to exact read/invoke routes.
It removes inbound Cookie/Authorization headers before proxying. Embedded mode
has Agents, prompt/hosted playground and Monitor only, plus **Back to
Trading**; it does not expose independent login, Models, Tools, Guardrails or
outage controls. Local trading-password users receive an explicit 403.

Prompt definitions supply `runtimeImage`, `model`, `instructions` and optional
captured built-in tool objects. Hosted definitions supply `image`, `model` and
application-specific `environment` bindings. Do not override platform identity,
model, state or telemetry environment variables. Radius sampling fields
`temperature`/`top_p` use validated decimal strings because its type catalogue
does not support fractional numbers; the UI receives numeric values.
The editor's writer/auditor URLs must pin concrete releases. Peer grants are
explicit; no discovery, automatic active resolution or replay is added.
Read the peer's actual identity binding before authoring `peers`: in connected
provisioning, `agentId` is the Entra Agent ID GUID mirrored into the Keycloak
`agent_id` claim, not the deterministic Keycloak client-name string.

Optional governance supplies canonical `ProxyConfig` JSON, its SHA-256,
`audit`/`enforce`, and the exact policy reference/content. Use the shipped
`governance_sidecar.contracts` validation/canonicalization rather than inventing
a second policy format. Default-deny policies are enforced by the locked AGT
sidecar without modifying agent code. Unsupported policies fail readiness;
the catalogue alone is not proof of runtime enforcement.

Platform-scoped policies are not automatically attached or reapplied by this
operator-free capability. Governance must be explicitly captured in a release
declaration. Shared model ingress currently routes directly to the model gateway,
without a global AGT enforcement hop. Consequently, publishing a global PII
policy does not protect every agent or UI model call. Current proxy stages are
`pre_input` and `pre_tool`; output filtering/redaction is not implemented.

Deploy policies independently through `radius/agent-policy.bicep`, passing
`environment`, `policyName`, canonical `policyContent` and `policyDigest`.
`PolicyDefinition.canonical()` produces the content; compute its SHA-256 from
the exact UTF-8 bytes. The qualified development policy is:

```json
{
  "policies": [{
    "apiVersion": "governance.toolkit/v1",
    "name": "demo-model-boundary",
    "default_action": "deny",
    "rules": [
      {"name": "deny-pii", "stage": "pre_input", "condition": "pii == 'detected'", "action": "deny"},
      {"name": "deny-injection", "stage": "pre_input", "condition": "prompt_injection == 'detected'", "action": "deny"},
      {"name": "local-model", "stage": "pre_input", "condition": "resource == 'local-chat'", "action": "allow"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

Use the resulting native reference, `<namespace>/<configmap>@sha256:<digest>`,
with `PolicySnapshot`, `compose_bundle` and `ProxyConfig` to capture the
release's exact proxy configuration and digest. ConfigMap names are opaque
lowercase Radius names; only the SHA-256 suffix is hexadecimal. The retained
custom sidecar supplies the transparent OpenAI/SSE bridge; detection and policy
evaluation use upstream AGT. The prebuilt AGT detection HTTP server is not a
drop-in transparent proxy for unchanged agent images.

### Local browser access and users

For the single-host development configuration, discover the stock Envoy
Service and forward only loopback ports:

```bash
service=$(kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get services \
  -l "gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name=ui-ingress,gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-namespace=$NAMESPACE" \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward --address 127.0.0.1 \
  "service/$service" 8443:8443 8444:8444
```

The UI is `https://localhost:8443`; Keycloak is `https://localhost:8444`.
Trust the declared TLS certificate, which must contain the public host SAN.
For command-line checks, use
`curl --cacert .adaptive/private/ui-tls.crt https://localhost:8443/healthz`.
Browser qualification uses a scoped development trust store, not
`ignoreHTTPSErrors`, disabled certificate verification or global trust changes.

The Keycloak administrator console is `https://localhost:8444/admin/`.
Sign into the `master` realm as `admin` using the durable private administrator
password (`.adaptive/private/keycloak-admin-password` in the qualified demo).
In the `adaptive` realm, create approved development users, set permanent
passwords and assign the **client role** `agent.invoke` on
`adaptive-platform-api` (Users -> Role mapping -> Filter by clients). The login
recipe creates that role; `ada oidc demo-users --namespace "$NAMESPACE"
--release "$RELEASE"` performs this optional demo setup automatically.
Do not grant administrator roles to ordinary users. The qualified users are
`alice` and `bob`; their generated passwords are recorded only in the
mode-0600 `.adaptive/private/demo-users.json`. Reuse existing users/passwords;
do not regenerate credentials to repeat setup.

Use the UI's Sign in action and authorization-code PKCE. Do not enable password
grants on `adaptive-ui`. Browser model discovery uses `/models/v1/models`,
rewritten to the gateway's `/v1/models`; `/v1/models` on the browser origin is
not a model discovery wrapper. Native agent calls pin
`/agents/{name}/responses` and send `store: false`.
Stored/background/reference operations remain denied. Monitor uses
authenticated streaming fetch at `/v1/agents/{name}/spans`.

### Mutable update and retention qualification

For an integrated logical `writer`, `app.bicep` creates separately owned
identity and agent resources while exposing one stable endpoint. Update the
definition or image digest by redeploying that application. A standalone
application can use `agents.bicep` for the same composition. Wait for the
singleton StatefulSet to reach its current revision and for the route and
policies to report their current generation before invoking the endpoint.

There is no previous-release fallback. During an unavailable rollout the
diagnostic record remains explicit and does not synthesize a ready endpoint.
Identity credentials and the state PVC are retained independently; updates do
not regenerate credentials or prune state. Deleting or purging either retained
owner requires a separate explicit authorized operation.

## Models

Native setup requires explicit model and gateway declarations, not an implicit
CPU server. New generated configurations contain no models. KAITO is an
explicit `ada agents-config --with-kaito-model` opt-in and is not enabled by an
`*-ai` portfolio. Reuse [GPU preparation](../../tutorials/common/prepare-gpu-kaito.md),
`Radius.Resources/aiModels` for individual inference backends and
`Radius.Resources/aiGateways` for the pinned LiteLLM endpoint:

| Binding | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `localWorkspace` with `recipe: "kaito"` | KAITO custom Workspace, pinned vLLM image/model revision, NVIDIA runtime and retained HF cache |
| `localService` | An existing compatible inference Service; no runtime or CPU provisioning |
| `azure` | Foundry-hosted OpenAI deployment with gateway workload identity |
An `aiModels` resource never owns routing or fallback. It returns neutral backend
connection facts. The corresponding `aiGateways` resource consumes those facts and owns
the public alias, LiteLLM `order`, `weight`, fallback and retry behavior.
The default model recipe contains no KAITO resource types. GPU workspaces select
the separate named `kaito` recipe, so clusters using hosted models do not need
the KAITO CRDs installed.

Public OpenAI uses an `openai` model binding and a separate private key file:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKeyFile": "/home/user/.config/adaptive/openai.key",
  "models": [{
    "name": "openai-chat",
    "properties": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "openai": {
        "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

`ada agents-config --with-openai-model --openai-api-key-file PATH` generates
this declaration and selects `openai-chat`. `ada init` retains the key in its
mode-0600 private state, writes it to the `model-gateway-auth` Secret, and
derives the private Radius application parameters used by the trading sample.
The emitted shell command never contains the key. Radius model properties and
generated LiteLLM ConfigMaps contain `os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY`, never the
credential. A changed source key fails instead of silently rotating the
retained credential.

`radius/agents.example.json` selects Qwen3-0.6B on a real GPU. The small serving
profile is not evidence of production quality or delegated-tool support.
For separately authored delivery, `radius/agent-models.bicep` declares local and
optional Foundry model resources plus a hybrid gateway; the gateway uses the
model resources' actual endpoint, provider and deployment outputs.
`localName` identifies the Radius/KAITO resource; `localModel` can preserve an
existing public model alias without changing agent artifacts.
Mount the chosen gateway ConfigMaps in the portfolio's
`agents.modelGateway.configs`, with their returned `configDigest` values.
ConfigMap projection alone does not reload LiteLLM: refresh the owning portfolio
release with reviewed changed digests after model delivery. Do not patch Pods or
independently Helm-install over a Radius-owned release.

### Foundry workload identity

Foundry authentication belongs to the gateway, not an agent blueprint, browser
bearer or Graph provisioner. The public CLI configuration is:

```json
{
  "modelGatewayIdentity": {"clientId": "<gateway-UAMI-client-id>", "tenantId": "<tenant-id>"},
  "models": [{
    "name": "foundry-chat",
    "properties": {
      "model": "foundry-chat",
      "azure": {
        "provider": "azure",
        "endpoint": "https://<account>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
        "deployment": "<existing-OpenAI-deployment>",
        "apiVersion": "2024-10-21"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

Merge these fields into the full reviewed agents configuration. Grant the
gateway managed identity scoped inference access on that Foundry account, for
example **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**. Its federated credential must match
the cluster's actual HTTPS OIDC signer, subject
`system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:model-gateway` and audience
`api://AzureADTokenExchange`. Follow the existing Arc/OIDC preparation; an
unconnected k3d cluster cannot borrow another cluster's signer. Preserve other
owners' federated credentials and logical Agent IDs.

The chart projects a renewable Kubernetes assertion only into LiteLLM and selects
`WorkloadIdentityCredential`; it does not require a webhook, Azure API key or
client secret for this gateway. The traditional LiteLLM `azure` provider uses
the Cognitive Services token audience. This is distinct from Foundry's newer
`/openai/v1` SDK examples using `https://ai.azure.com/.default`; do not mix the
provider, endpoint and audience contracts.
See [Microsoft's keyless inference guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/managed-identity).
Only claim connected cloud inference after the actual gateway can invoke the
configured deployment with its own identity.

### Priority, fallback and weights

Lower `priority` becomes lower native LiteLLM `order` and is preferred. Equal
orders use relative `weight`; higher orders provide fallback. The pinned
LiteLLM 1.104.2 router can advance orders despite zero general retries. Its
native fallback includes upstream authentication/permission errors, not only
transport failures; content-policy/context errors have separate handling.
Caller authorization still happens at Envoy before the gateway and cannot be
bypassed by provider fallback.

Choose local-first or cloud-first explicitly through the authored priorities.
Cloud-only aliases fail when cloud access is unavailable; hybrid aliases may use
their configured reachable local member. Verify actual upstream failure,
primary selection, streaming and recovery before claiming fallback qualification.
Do not replay output already emitted or represent upstream denial fallback as
transport-only policy.

## Connectivity and the demo button

Connectivity is not deployment mode. Agents always obtain paired Keycloak
application tokens directly for the in-cluster Agent and Model Gateways,
including while Azure is reachable. Delegated Graph calls use the connected
colocated broker and Entra sidecar and fail explicitly on outage;
denials/timeouts never substitute a local or application actor.

The UI button calls strict `GET/PATCH /v1/connectivity-fault`. The only write
patches `demo-cloud-egress` with optimistic concurrency, validating its exact
label, selector and rules. Enabling the fault removes public HTTPS egress from
selected agents/model gateway. Baseline policies retain local identity,
gateway, telemetry and DNS access. No Pod restart, identity reconfiguration,
login-provider toggle, global mode ConfigMap or turn replay occurs.

NetworkPolicies are additive: another public-egress grant defeats this
injection. The reported value is fault configuration, not WAN reachability,
completed CNI enforcement, cached-token revocation or termination of established
connections. Hybrid fallback uses the native semantics documented above, not a
custom transport-only router. Zero general retries does not disable native
order-based fallback after upstream permission errors.

Qualification must verify actual cloud HTTPS loss, not just the button value.
Request an unused cloud audience during the fault to test a cold token mint,
exercise fresh local PKCE login and prompt/hosted calls, then restore the fault
in guaranteed cleanup and prove cloud minting recovers. Record selected Pod
UIDs/restart counts before and after. A cached, still-valid Graph token can
remain available during the outage; this is not new cloud minting or a local
actor fallback. Established connections and all cache-expiry behavior are not
qualified by this test.

Connected identity qualification uses the official sidecar's
`/AuthorizationHeaderUnauthenticated/qualification` endpoint on localhost,
with query overrides `AgentIdentity=<actual-agent-id>`,
`optionsOverride.Scopes=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` and
`optionsOverride.RequestAppToken=true`. Keep the blueprint assertion confined
to the sidecar. Never publish or persist the returned bearer.
Microsoft-owned access tokens are opaque to clients: validation belongs to
the target API, not a generic local JWT verifier
([Microsoft access-token guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens)).
The qualified app token is accepted by Graph's authentication boundary and
denied on delegated-only `/me`; decoded actor claims are diagnostic evidence,
not a replacement authorization check. Cognitive Services cold-mint recovery
proves token issuance only, not access to a configured cloud model.

## Verification status

Source validation covers native recipe/application compilation (including the
unchanged trading application), chart rendering, paired identity Terraform
tests, SDK/sidecar regressions, actual nginx template substitution/configuration
validation and diagnostic API/UI tests.
Run `python3 radius/tests/native_agents.py` (PyYAML and Bicep/Helm required),
`just --justfile src/Justfile lint`, `test` and `build`; run `terraform test`
from the individual initialized identity/login recipe directories.

The following dated evidence qualified the prior Radius-owned standalone
foundation, not the shared portfolio/CLI integration. Requalify the new path
before treating these results as its deployment evidence.

On 2026-10-13, the explicitly scoped old host demo cluster was wiped and a fresh
K3s datastore/cluster UID established without restoring its old PVCs or lifecycle
operator. Trusted server admission dry-run, stock DNS/storage, Radius installation
and fresh Arc onboarding passed. The Kubernetes signer matches the exact Arc
HTTPS discovery issuer and its public JWKS was verified. OIDC and workload
identity are enabled; the official webhook is ready. All six current native
images were built/imported, with no operator image.

The fresh native foundation and writer/auditor prompt plus hosted editor v1
releases are qualified. Both local users completed real PKCE and browser login,
gateway model discovery, direct native foreground invocation and SSE.
The hosted editor called pinned writer/auditor v1 peers. Captured AGT policy
allowed normal calls and denied the PII/injection fixtures; stored/background/
reference operations were denied. Monitor returned actual SDK spans and a
trace-correlated `guardrail.decision` log, not only heartbeats.

All three official Entra sidecars completed autonomous exact-agent Graph
exchanges; Graph validated the tokens and denied delegated-only access.
Assertions remained absent from agent containers. Real cloud HTTPS loss,
uncached Cognitive Services mint failure, fresh local login, local agent
continuity and recovered cloud minting passed with unchanged selected Pod UIDs
and restart counts. The fault was restored to off.

Separate writer v2/v3 releases were invoked, explicitly selected and retired;
missing selection returned 404 without fallback. The final selection is v1.
The v3 test persisted exact before/after capture/PVC UIDs and proved logical
identity and other agents unchanged. Retired endpoints returned 404; retained
v2/v3 capture/state remains. Server admission dry-runs accepted valid updates
and rejected replica two, duplicate platform environment bindings and logical
type changes. Chart `0.2.1` fixes optional `AdmissionRequest.subResource`
handling and matches CREATE requests through object metadata.

Evidence is under `.adaptive/diagnostics/` in `native-invocation.json`,
`native-browser.json`, `native-monitor.json`, `entra-sidecar-exchange.json`,
`native-outage.json`, `native-lifecycle{,-before}.json` and `admission-*.txt`.
Radius deployment/retirement logs are under rebuildable `build/bootstrap/`.
Private user passwords/tokens and provisioning inputs are not evidence to
publish. Session-only qualification helpers are not an installation dependency.

No existing installation ownership handover was performed. Restart fencing,
SDK stored-state caller isolation and durable telemetry replay remain separate
gates. Six existing SDK isolation tests remain expected failures; denied stored
Responses must not be exposed. Human Entra federation/OBO, evaluation Jobs and
same-image cloud hosting remain separate gates; the later model evidence below
does not qualify those capabilities.

### GPU, keyless Foundry models and login evidence

Later on 2026-10-13, the existing host cluster exposed one real RTX 3090 GPU.
Stock KAITO 0.10.0 deployed pinned Qwen3-0.6B through Radius; the retained cache,
actual GPU allocation and recreated desired serving arguments were verified.
The CPU model was retired through Radius in both the host and isolated setup
proof; only its obsolete weight PVCs were removed.

The existing gateway's Radius owner deployed the corrected multi-model chart,
without a platform ownership handover or identity/credential regeneration.
The chart regression fixes router settings accidentally rendered inside the
model include loop. An exact current-cluster federation was added to the
reviewed gateway identity without replacing its previous federation.
Real Foundry `gpt-4o-mini` inference uses renewable
`WorkloadIdentityCredential`, not an Azure API key.

Gateway provenance headers verified local-first hybrid selection. Stopping the
actual KAITO workload produced Foundry fallback for ordinary and streaming
requests; KAITO recovered with unchanged Workspace/cache UIDs. Local, Foundry
and hybrid SSE all reached `[DONE]`. Unchanged prompt/hosted releases and pinned
peer calls passed for both local users, including native Responses streaming
and stored/background/reference/guardrail denials.

Both Alice and Bob passed trusted-browser PKCE login. Their original and
isolated-proof password files differ; restored localhost forwarding selects the
original demo and its `.adaptive/private/demo-users.json`. Neither account was
disabled or locked, and no password reset was needed.

Evidence is in `.adaptive/diagnostics/native-model-proof.json`,
`native-model-fallback.json`, `native-invocation.json` and `native-browser.json`.
Seven native compilation/render checks, CLI tests/clippy, chart lint and GPU
helper shell syntax passed. The isolated shared-portfolio browser proof remains
separate from the original foundation; its Monitor hierarchy check is not yet
qualified.

Read-only Jaeger inspection later on 2026-10-13 confirmed that the shared
collector receives actual SDK spans under the correct release service names.
Prompt traces contain `invoke_agent writer` with a child `chat local-chat`, and
hosted-to-prompt calls preserve the trace and parent IDs. They do not contain
the originally specified intermediate `agent_run` span. Microsoft's current
[direct A365 contract](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-agent-365/developer/direct-open-telemetry-integration#message-contracts)
accepts `invoke_agent`, `chat`, `execute_tool` and `output_messages`, not
`agent_run`. The old three-level requirement therefore remains a specification
decision, not evidence that the collector lost a supported A365 operation.
Do not manufacture or rename spans to pass that gate.
The min-ai collector also has no metrics pipeline, while
the image's SDK emits metrics, producing explicit HTTP 404 export errors.
After CPU-model retirement, the isolated setup's old gateway configuration
still references the removed CPU backend; it is not a currently qualified
inference installation. The host cluster's GPU/Foundry proof remains separate.

On 2026-10-14, `agent-release:0.4.1` restored the stock per-agent trace collector
in the original host cluster through new Radius `otel-v2` releases. The prompt
and hosted agent image digests were unchanged. Both users completed prompt and
hosted peer invocation; writer SSE and stored/background denials also passed.
The authenticated Monitor stream returned 28 native spans from those requests,
with exact agent/version/tenant/blueprint attributes and preserved peer trace
IDs. Actual browser Monitor sessions for both users displayed the live
`invoke_agent` and `chat` A365 badges. All 13 pre-existing
logical/identity/release captures and PVCs retained
their UIDs and immutable content. The ready `otel-v2` releases were then
explicitly selected through Radius.

The `otel-v2` hosted editor emitted HTTP spans, not its own `invoke_agent`:
its writer/auditor peers emit native `invoke_agent` and `chat` spans in the same
trace. That instrumentation limitation is separate from the repaired delivery
path. Neither an intermediate `agent_run` nor cloud A365 ingestion is claimed.
Evidence is retained in
`.adaptive/diagnostics/a365-delivery/{invocation-monitor,retention,browser}.json`.

On 2026-10-14, the editor's new `af-v1` release replaced that instrumentation
limitation with Agent Framework's native `AgentTelemetryLayer`. The pipeline
still calls writer then auditor through OpenAI-compatible Responses clients
and DAC, with explicit `otel-v2` peer versions. It has no Foundry project client,
new LLM, workflow engine, handwritten span or propagation hook. SDK-managed
HTTPX instrumentation propagates the real editor invocation context. The editor
image was rebuilt and pinned to OCI digest
`sha256:05cc88a5d1cb050e38077ba781614230949c699f71d72e441125817cbad69fb0`;
writer/auditor images and previous release declarations were not changed.

Real foreground calls for both users and an editor streaming call delivered
`invoke_agent editor` with child peer HTTP calls, native peer `invoke_agent`
and their child `chat` spans to the authenticated Monitor. Exact trace ancestry
and agent/version/tenant/blueprint metadata were verified; the editor itself
does not call a model or execute a tool. Stored/background execution remained
denied. The ready editor release was explicitly selected through Radius, and
all 25 previous captures/PVCs retained exact UIDs and immutable content.
All 34 editor tests, Ruff checks and strict mypy passed, including real OTLP
export, cross-task streaming and foreground/streaming error reporting.
Evidence is retained in
`.adaptive/diagnostics/editor-framework/{workload,invocation-monitor,retention}.json`.
Initial hosted-editor browser Monitor qualification did not pass: the Monitor request
returned HTTP 503 (`Kubernetes operational data unavailable`), with inventory
requests also returning HTTP 504. Browser login and selected-release metadata
worked. The subsequent operational-inventory qualification below resolves this
browser gate; the earlier failure is retained here as historical context.
Cloud hosting and Microsoft 365 cloud ingestion remain separate unqualified
gates; this change does not manufacture `agent_run` or claim metrics delivery.

## Operational inventory latency qualification

On 2026-10-14, authenticated browser measurements for both development users
confirmed slow inventory reads and version selection. Per-row release polling
compounded serial per-release Kubernetes GETs against client-go's default
5-QPS limiter. Exact selection also qualified unrelated retained runtimes.

The API now shares fresh namespace lists within an inventory operation and
performs a second ConfigMap list to verify capture content/UID and identity
ownership. Complete inventory requires nine LISTs, independently of retained
release count; regression tests cover 1 and 20 releases, including retirement.
Exact selection qualifies only the selected and Radius-requested active
runtimes, while full inventory still validates all releases. Readiness,
singleton, generation/revision, state and ownership requirements remain intact.
There is no cross-request cache, and every streaming Monitor poll starts a fresh
inventory scope. Interactive Kubernetes reads use bounded QPS 20 / burst 30.

Agent-list responses include release summaries. The UI removes per-row polling,
seeds playground metadata/release queries from those summaries and reuses the
release inventory for ten seconds. Hidden A2A tabs no longer fetch or poll.
Conversation submission still resolves and pins an exact native release;
view selection does not declare promotion.

| Measured operation | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agents API | 12.80–14.73 s | 0.40–1.22 s |
| Editor release inventory API | 5.39–5.42 s | 0.05–0.28 s |
| Exact editor detail API | 5.77–5.80 s | 0.06–0.31 s |
| Browser Agents list | 14.63–14.65 s | 0.124–0.127 s |
| Browser editor opening | 28.16–30.10 s | 0.057–0.098 s |
| Browser version selection | 7.91–10.40 s | 0.097–1.820 s |

Both users passed the explicit two-second API/interaction gate and produced
no hidden A2A requests or browser JavaScript errors. These are bounded local
observations, not percentile or load-test guarantees.
Both actual editor browser Monitors displayed Live and native
`invoke_agent editor` A365 badges. Fresh foreground/SSE invocation and peer
trace ancestry also passed; stored/background requests remained denied.

The existing host still uses its earlier Radius-owned platform installation.
This qualification upgraded that exact chart to immutable `agent-platform`
0.2.3 through Radius, changing only API/UI image digests and two read-only LIST
permissions. It did not perform the separate parent-portfolio ownership handover.
All 53 captured ConfigMap, PVC and agent StatefulSet UID/content signatures
were unchanged. An initial browser attempt encountered an unavailable Envoy
listener and stopped port-forward; native ingress recovered and the local
forward was restored before the successful checks. That failed attempt is
retained separately, not counted as a successful result.

The operational API race/vet checks, all 208 UI tests, ESLint/TypeScript, SPA
build and chart lint passed. Evidence is retained in
`.adaptive/diagnostics/ui-latency/{before,after,retention,initial-transport-failure}.json`
and `.adaptive/diagnostics/editor-framework/{invocation-monitor,browser}.json`.

## Pending Foundry 1:1 agent-hosting proof

**Status: initial-deployment source implemented and tested, not live-qualified.**
Track this separately from calling Foundry models through the edge gateway.
The cloud gate currently covers native deployment, not unchanged editor peer
invocation or complete identity/state lifecycle evidence.

`radius/recipes/foundry-agent` is a stock Terraform recipe using pinned
AzAPI 2.9.0 and the native data-plane type `Microsoft.Foundry/agents@v1`.
`radius/foundry-env.bicep` binds it to `Radius.Resources/agents`;
`radius/foundry-agent.bicep` authors one mutable named agent.
There is no operator, management emulator,
image build or invocation proxy.

Dispatch remains **prompt → native Foundry prompt agent** and
**hosted → native Foundry hosted agent**. Prompt instructions/model/sampling
become a prompt definition; the edge `runtimeImage` is not deployed.
Hosted images must use an ACR URL retaining the original SHA-256 manifest
digest and Responses container protocol 2.0.0.
`binding: null` explicitly selects native Foundry identity instead of fake edge
Secret/ServiceAccount references. Foundry manages the cloud blueprint and
agent identity; the project identity pulls the image, and the native runtime
identity receives required downstream permissions. `nativeIdentity` returns
the actual provider client/principal and blueprint IDs, not edge identity
substitutes.

### Foundry ownership limitation

AzAPI manages one **named mutable agent** per Radius agent. Its native name
includes a hash of the stable Radius resource ID and is returned as
`nativeName`. Updating the Radius definition updates that same Foundry agent.
This avoids adopting unrelated existing agents that happen to share a display
name. Use new proof-only logical names and one deployment owner; do not
import/adopt an existing cloud agent or interpret Terraform state locking as
distributed fencing.

The Foundry runtime is not the retained identity owner. Provider write success
and the recipe endpoint output do not prove readiness, effective guardrails or
successful invocation. Native cloud identity and service state require their
own qualified retention and deletion evidence.

### Current Responses routing difference

Both images use native Responses hosts and serve `/responses`. Public routing
differs:

| Target | Public Responses path | Runtime selection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge Envoy | `/agents/{name}/responses` | Current Radius agent |
| Foundry | `/api/projects/{project}/agents/{name}/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses` | Current native named agent |

The unchanged editor validates an exact edge-style peer base path in
`src/agents/editor/src/editor/agent.py` before sending a request. It rejects
native Foundry project-prefixed endpoints, and it does not create/pass a native
candidate session. Deployment of the same image can be tested without claiming
that its writer/auditor calls work in Foundry. Do not hide this limitation with
an Envoy compatibility route or silently rebuild the image.

### Source delivery and remaining live gate

The environment requires an explicitly selected existing `projectEndpoint`,
existing full `raiPolicyId`, immutable `agentRecipe` archive and native Azure
`recipeConfig` credentials.
No project or registry is chosen or provisioned automatically. Use the existing
Radius credential-store/workload-identity patterns; no browser bearer or Azure
API key belongs in these parameters.

Include `foundry-agent` and its reviewed `.terraform.lock.hcl` in the immutable
Terraform archive, excluding `.terraform`, test files and state. Point
`agentRecipe` to `<immutable-archive-url>//foundry-agent`.
Deliver the environment once, then the authored agent declaration:

```bash
rad deploy radius/foundry-env.bicep \
  --parameters .adaptive/private/foundry-env.parameters.json
rad deploy radius/foundry-agent.bicep \
  --parameters .adaptive/private/foundry-prompt.parameters.json
rad deploy radius/foundry-agent.bicep \
  --parameters .adaptive/private/foundry-hosted.parameters.json
```

The private parameter files are explicit authored inputs, not generated
installation defaults. A prompt `definition` has `kind: prompt`, the selected
native model deployment and matching instructions. A hosted `definition` has
`kind: hosted`, its unchanged ACR image digest, the required `model` contract
field and reviewed native environment bindings. Nonempty tools, edge governance,
PVC state, edge resource settings, prompt container environment and
platform-reserved identity variables fail explicitly. The existing native RAI
policy is used; tool/skill parity and Graph OBO remain unqualified.

Eight Radius compilation/chart checks and ten mocked Terraform lifecycle
checks cover dispatch, digest preservation, replay, immutable input rejection,
extra release rejection, unexpected native versions, edge-binding rejection,
untrusted project URLs, foreign guardrails and invalid sandbox sizes.
Mocks and rendered files are not live proof.

and [endpoint/version management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/manage-hosted-agent).

1. Verify the current Foundry native prompt and hosted-agent APIs, Responses
   support, identity/blueprint support and cloud model/peer bindings. Preserve
   prompt instructions, model selection and supported tool/skill content;
   explicitly flag unsupported features rather than silently dropping them.
   Establish idempotent named-agent updates and stable native endpoint routing.
2. Select an explicitly approved Foundry project, region, registry, identities
   and billing/compute scope. Mirror the existing hosted editor OCI image with
   an **identical manifest digest**, without rebuilding; verify registry pull
   and inference permissions. The prompt runtime image remains edge-only.
3. Qualify the initial cloud recipe and required target bindings. Supply
   native cloud identity/configuration rather than edge Keycloak/gateway endpoints,
   sidecars or PVC paths. Replaying identical desired state must not allocate
   another agent or replace a logical identity. Identity/state retirement
   remains separate from this runtime proof.
4. Deploy **both native Foundry kinds**. Verify the prompt resource
   really has prompt kind and matching supported definition content, and the
   hosted resource uses the unchanged OCI digest. Verify provider provenance,
   active native definitions and real native identity. Test prompt foreground
   Responses/SSE and model access. Record unchanged editor peer invocation as
   unqualified because of its URL/session assumptions. Preserve unrelated
   projects and record sanitized evidence in the existing guides. Do not claim
   retirement, tool/skill/OBO or full state portability from
   a successful initial deployment.

The portability gates differ by kind: **prompt agents require native kind and
definition/content parity; hosted agents require unchanged image-digest parity**.
A native Foundry prompt agent has no user-supplied OCI image. The edge
prompt-runtime container is an edge implementation detail, not the cloud
deployment artifact.
