# Prepare an Azure Arc-enabled Cluster

This is the Arc preparation step for the existing
[getting-started flow](../getting-started/README.md). Arc is host/platform
preparation, not an application recipe or agent lifecycle controller.
`ada bootstrap --platform arc` consumes the selected cluster; it does not
onboard it or configure its Kubernetes token issuer.

## Prerequisites

- A reachable Kubernetes cluster, trusted kubeconfig, enforcing CNI and
  persistent storage. Use the existing [K3s](prepare-k3s.md) or
  [Azure Local](prepare-azure-local.md) guide as appropriate.
- Azure CLI with the `connectedk8s` extension and authorized access to the exact
  subscription/resource group. Install missing tools through their normal
  package/extension mechanism.
- Outbound access required by
  [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/network-requirements).
  Installation/onboarding is connected work, not offline provisioning.
- An explicitly selected Arc resource name. Do not attach a new cluster to
  somebody else's registration or delete an existing resource by display name.

## Connect the cluster

On WSL, use a Linux Azure CLI installed inside the distro, not the Windows
installation inherited through `PATH`. Check `command -v az`: a path under
`/mnt/c/` runs on Windows, where `127.0.0.1:6443` is not necessarily the WSL
K3s endpoint. A `[WinError 10061]` during `/version/` discovery can indicate
this mismatch even while Linux `kubectl get nodes` succeeds. Install Azure CLI
using Microsoft's supported Linux installation procedure, select its Linux
executable, and authenticate in that CLI. Do not expose the API server or
disable TLS verification to work around a client-platform mismatch.

Set reviewed, non-secret identifiers and select the trusted kubeconfig:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=<trusted-cluster-kubeconfig>
export RESOURCE_GROUP=<existing-resource-group>
export CLUSTER_NAME=<new-owned-Arc-cluster-name>
kubectl get nodes
az account show --query '{subscription:id,tenant:tenantId}' -o table
```

For a new cluster that needs Entra workload federation:

```bash
az connectedk8s connect \
  --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --kube-config "$KUBECONFIG" \
  --enable-oidc-issuer --enable-workload-identity \
  --disable-auto-upgrade
```

For the same already-owned cluster, enable missing features with
`az connectedk8s update --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP"
--enable-oidc-issuer --enable-workload-identity`; do not create a second owner.
The OIDC/WI flags are currently preview in the CLI. Explicit agent upgrades
remain an operator responsibility when automatic upgrades are disabled.

## Configure the actual Kubernetes signer

Enabling Arc's issuer endpoint alone does not change the API server's token
issuer. Retrieve the exact URL, including its trailing slash:

```bash
export OIDC_ISSUER="$(az connectedk8s show \
  --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl -o tsv)"
test -n "$OIDC_ISSUER"
```

On a systemd-managed K3s host, add the following configuration using the
returned value to a reviewed file under `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml.d/`:

```yaml
kube-apiserver-arg:
  - service-account-issuer=<exact-Arc-OIDC-issuer>
  - service-account-max-token-expiration=24h
```

Review existing API server arguments rather than replacing unrelated
configuration. Restart only that host's `k3s` service. Other Kubernetes
distributions require their supported API server configuration mechanism;
this host step does not apply inside a k3d container.

**Do this before installing Radius and applications.** Pods created before
the issuer change can retain projected assertions with the former issuer and
receive Kubernetes `Unauthorized` errors. If preparation order was reversed,
perform a deliberate rollout of the affected bootstrap controllers and verify
their API access. Do not retain the old issuer as a compatibility workaround.

## Verify federation prerequisites

```bash
az connectedk8s show --name "$CLUSTER_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query '{state:provisioningState,connectivity:connectivityStatus,oidc:oidcIssuerProfile.enabled,issuer:oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl,workloadIdentity:securityProfile.workloadIdentity.enabled}'
kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  "${OIDC_ISSUER}.well-known/openid-configuration"
kubectl -n arc-workload-identity rollout status \
  deployment/azure-wi-webhook-controller-manager --timeout=180s
```

The cluster and public discovery documents must report the same exact issuer;
fetch the public discovery document's `jwks_uri` with TLS verification and
confirm that it publishes signing keys. Never disable certificate verification
to make the check pass. `Connected` alone does not prove federation.

Workload credentials must then use an exact federated subject
`system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account>` and audience
`api://AzureADTokenExchange`. Verify an actual token exchange at the downstream
service, not just the presence of a webhook, annotation or projected file.

For native agents, only the official Entra sidecar receives the blueprint
assertion. The agent uses Keycloak for platform calls, not the blueprint
credentials. See [native agent delivery](../../docs/agents/native-radius.md).
Cloud-only tokens/services remain unavailable during an outage; local paired
identity is a separate mechanism, not a substitute cloud actor.

After these checks, return to
[§2 Bring up the platform](../getting-started/README.md#2-bring-up-the-platform).
For the optional native agent capability, use its Radius-owned delivery branch
instead of installing a second owner over the same shared identity/ingress.
